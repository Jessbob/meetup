        "<p>Today we have the pleasure to welcome Andreas Fertig to our user group. Andreas is an independent trainer and consultant for C++ specializing in embedded systems. It is because of his classes he developed cppinsights.io to make teaching C++ more visual. In the times Andreas is not working with C++ he creates macOS applications or enjoys his leasure time.</p> <p>------------------------------<br/>Abstract: With the help of C++ Insights we’ll dive into how things work in C++, through the eyes of the compiler.</p> <p>For example we’ll look at some apparently simple cases like implicit conversions, and how in-class initializers work. We won’t stop there though! We’ll also walk through how the compiler generates lambdas and explore why you might care.</p> <p>And of course this is C++ so it would be remiss of us not to also take a peek at one of our favourite C++ features: variadic templates!</p> <p>Welcome to the compiler’s world with C++ Insights, and at the very least come away from the talk with a whole new way of looking at the code you write!</p> <p>------------------------------<br/>Schedule:<br/>19:00 -- Welcome with snacks and drinks<br/>19:30 -- Welcome by our host<br/>19:35 -- Lightning talk<br/>19:45 -- Main talk<br/>~21:00 -- Open discussions<br/>22:00 -- Official end</p> ",
